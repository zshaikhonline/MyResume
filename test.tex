%Studied nonlocal theory of elasticity which takes account of remote action forces between atoms
%
%This causes the stresses to depend on the strains not only at an individual point
%under consideration, but at all points of the body
%
%Mechanical behavior calculated by Classical elastic theory will differ from non
%local theory

%\subsection{Review}

%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
